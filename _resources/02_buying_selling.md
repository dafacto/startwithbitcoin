intro: Suggested options for where to buy, sell and hold your bitcoin.
---

Remember that a fundamental choice is whether to trust the security of your bitcoin to yourself, or to an organization that can be thought of as a "Bitcoin bank"—or a combination of the two. 

Even though they are not technically "banks", we'll use that term to differentiate between the do-it-yourself options.

### Bitcoin Banks

Most businesses that let you buy and sell bitcoin, also provide wallet services, allowing you to store, send and receive bitcoin.

- [Crypto.com](https://crypto.com) (Global) — Crypto.com, an app for iOS and Android, allows you to buy and sell bitcoin, using bank transfer and credit card. They also have an interest earning savings account, a debit card allowing you to spend your bitcoin anywhere Visa is accepted, and allow you to use your bitcoin as collateral for a loan!

- [Cash App](https://cash.app) (USA) — Cash App, an app for iOS and Android, is one of the most popular and easy options in the United States, for purchasing bitcoin.

- [Swan Bitcoin](https://www.swanbitcoin.com) (USA) — Swan Bitcoin is a great option for building up some bitcoin over time. Link the app to your bank account, and turn on recurring purchases.

- [BlockFi](https://blockfi.com/?ref=2af7e511) (Global) — BlockFi is a US-regulated company that allows you to buy and sell bitcoin via bank transfer, earn interest, and use your bitcoin as collateral for a loan.

- [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com) (Global) — Coinbase is a popular option for buying and selling bitcoin. Once you create an account and link your bank account, you can transfer in dollars to buy bitcoin, and then transfer out dollars if you sell bitcoin.

### Do-it-yourself wallets

For those wanting to take full control for their bitcoin security, here are some do-it-yourself options that allow buying (but not selling) bitcoin.

- [Blue Wallet](https://bluewallet.io) — Blue Wallet is an app for iOS and Android, that allows you to buy Bitcoin with a credit card. Since it only stores bitcoin (and not other cryptocurrencies) its user interface is simple and easy to use.

- [BRD Wallet](https://brd.com) — BRD is a popular do-it-yourself mobile wallet for iOS and Android that allows you to buy (but not sell) bitcoin using a credit card.

- [Ledger Hardware Wallet](https://shop.ledger.com/?r=9be4f2a7e990) — Down the road, for the highest level of do-it-yourself security, you might look into a “hardware wallet”, such as the Ledger Nano. It pairs with the Ledger Live desktop computer software, and allows you to buy bitcoin (but not sell).

In closing, remember that sending bitcoin is as easy as sending email. So you can buy bitcoin at one place, send it (or a portion) to a wallet on your phone, and then later send it to another place to sell.

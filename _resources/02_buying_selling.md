intro: Suggested options for where to buy, sell and hold your bitcoin.

Remember that a fundamental choice is whether to trust the security of your bitcoin to yourself, or to an organization that can be thought of as a "Bitcoin bank". Even though these businesses are technically not "banks", we'll use that term to differentiate between them and the do-it-yourself options.

### Bitcoin banks

Most businesses that let you buy and sell bitcoin, also provide wallet services, allowing you to store, send and receive bitcoin.

- [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com) (Global) — Coinbase is a popular option for buying and selling bitcoin. Once you create an account and link your bank account, you can transfer in dollars to buy bitcoin, and then transfer out dollars if you sell bitcoin.

### Do-it-yourself wallets

For those wanting to take full control for their bitcoin security, here are some do-it-yourself options that allow buying (but not selling) bitcoin.

- [Blue Wallet](https://bluewallet.io) — Blue Wallet is an app for iOS and Android, that allows you to buy Bitcoin with a credit card. Since it only stores bitcoin (and not other cryptocurrencies) its user interface is simple and easy to use.

- [BRD Wallet](https://brd.com) — BRD is a popular do-it-yourself mobile wallet for iOS and Android that allows you to buy (but not sell) bitcoin using a credit card.

- [Ledger Hardware Wallet](https://shop.ledger.com/?r=9be4f2a7e990) — Down the road, for the highest level of do-it-yourself security, you might look into a “hardware wallet”, such as the Ledger Nano. It pairs with the Ledger Live desktop computer software, and allows you to buy bitcoin (but not sell).

In closing, remember that sending bitcoin is as easy as sending email. So you can buy bitcoin at one place, send it (or a portion) to a wallet on your phone, and then later send it to another place to sell.

Before getting to the options, keep these points in mind:

- Where you hold your bitcoin (your wallet) can be different from where you buy and sell your bitcoin, since bitcoin is as easily transferable as email.

- Although they are not technically "banks", we'll refer to businesses that buy and sell bitcoin as banks, since many offer Bitcoin-related financial services like savings accounts, loans and debit cards.

- If you store your bitcoin with a bitcoin bank, you're trusting them with the security of your bitcoin. If you do-it-yourself, you're trusting yourself!

- Remember that you can buy bitcoin at one place, send it (or a portion) to a wallet on your phone, and then later send it to another place to sell. You're in control!

### Bitcoin banks

Most bitcoin banks, also provide wallet services, allowing you to store, send and receive bitcoin.

### Do-it-yourself wallets

For those wanting to take self-control of their bitcoin security, here are some do-it-yourself wallets, from simple to complex.

- [Blue Wallet](https://bluewallet.io) — Blue Wallet, for iOS and Android, allows buying of bitcoin with a credit card. Since it only stores bitcoin, and no other cryptocurrencies, its user interface is simple and easy to use.

- [Ledger Hardware Wallet](https://shop.ledger.com/?r=9be4f2a7e990) — For the highest level of do-it-yourself security, you might look into a “hardware wallet”, such as a device from Ledger. It pairs with the Ledger Live desktop computer software, and allows you to buy bitcoin. A steep learning curve, but very high security.

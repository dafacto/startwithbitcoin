intro: A list of businesses who pay interest on deposited bitcoin, just like a traditional savings account.
---

In recent years, a number of businesses have emerged that offer something similar to a traditional savings account. You deposit bitcoin, and they pay you interest in bitcoin! When deciding whether to use these services, keep in mind that they, in turn, lend out your bitcoin to earn interest required to pay you! So there's risk involved.

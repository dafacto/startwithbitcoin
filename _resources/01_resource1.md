intro: Bitcoin is the internet’s native form of money.

You’re familiar with using **PayPal** or your **online bank** to send, receive and manage your “money” on the internet. Although convenient, there’s some problems:

- You need **permission** to have an account with PayPal or a bank. They have the power to close your account, block your transfers, and ask questions about your transactions. In short, they stand between you and the free use of your money. 
- If you want to send money to a friend in Canada or France, a **conversion** has to happen between your form of money, the US Dollar, and theirs. PayPal and banks charge a fee for this conversion.
- Your money **loses value** over time, as the government continually enlarges the money supply through inflation. A dollar today is worth 90% less than one in 1920.

**Bitcoin is the internet's native form of money**, and solves these problems. 

- **It's permissionless.** Just like email, anyone can access and use it, but nobody owns or controls it. Nobody can stop you from owning and using bitcoin.
- **It's global.** Bitcoin is a worldwide currency. Just like email, you can send bitcoin  as fast and freely to someone in Japan, as to your neighbor next door.
- **It has a limited supply.** By design, there will never be more than 21 million bitcoins.

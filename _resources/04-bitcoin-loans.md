intro: Businesses who allow you to get US dollar loans, using bitcoin as collateral.
type: resource
---

These businesses allow you to deposit bitcoin as collateral, and receive a US dollar loan. Why would you want to do that? If you need dollars, but don't want to sell your bitcoin.

How it works — These organizations typically require you to deposit bitcoin twice the value of the loan you need, and if the bitcoin price drops during the term of the loan, they'll ask you to deposit more, bringing the "loan-to-value" ratio back to 50%. If you can't deposit more, they'll sell your bitcoin collateral, in order to repay your debt obligation.

intro: A list of businesses who allow you to get US dollar loans, using bitcoin as collateral.
---

In recent years, a number of businesses have emerged that allow you to deposit bitcoin as collateral, and receive a US dollar loan. 

To understand how these work, here's an example: 

> Say you want a loan of $10,000. These organizations would require you to deposit, say, $20,000 worth of bitcoin as collateral. If the price of bitcoin drops during your loan term, to say, $15,000, you would be asked to deposit more bitcoin to bring the "Loan-to-Value" ratio back to 50%. And if you were unable to do that, they would sell your bitcoin in order to repay your debt obligation.

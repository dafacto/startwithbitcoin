intro: You can buy Bitcoin with a bank transfer, debit or credit card, or even person-to-person.

Here's a few options for those wishing to entrust the security of their Bitcoins to a professional. These allow both buying *and* selling of Bitcoin.

- **Coinbase** — The most popular online option, where they store your Bitcoin for you, is [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com). Once you create an account and link your bank account, you can transfer in dollars to buy Bitcoin, and then transfer out dollars if you sell Bitcoin.
- **Crypto.com** — Another great option is [Crypto.com](https://crypto.com/). Crypto.com is an app for iOS and Android that lets you buy Bitcoin with bank transfer or credit card. The also allows you to deposit your purchased Bitcoin into a "savings account", earning weekly interest. (And if you use my referral code `gpd9q473d2` you'll receive $50 on your first transaction.)

Here's a few options for those wishing to take responsibility for the security of their Bitcoins themselves. These allow you to buy Bitcoin with credit card, but not sell.

- **BRD Wallet** — The [BRD Wallet](https://brd.com) for iOS and Android is a great option.
- **Hardware Wallet** — Down the road, if you end up buying a lot of Bitcoin, you might look into the ultimate in security, a hardware wallet, such as the [Ledger Nano](https://shop.ledger.com/?r=9be4f2a7e990).

And here are some important points to keep in mind:

- All of the above options allow the buying and selling of *hundreds of cryptocurrencies*, including some with names like "Bitcoin Cash", which is something completely different than Bitcoin! Many people ignore all these other cryptocurrencies, and hold just the main one, Bitcoin.
- Don't forget that Bitcoin can be sent as easily as email. So if you bought Bitcoin at Crypto.com, you could easily send it to your BRD or Ledger wallet for storage, and then to Coinbase later for selling.
- You might hear people talking about "Bitcoin Exchanges", like Binance or Kraken. These are marketplaces where trading happens, similar to how stocks are traded in brokerage accounts. For someone who wants to just buy and hold Bitcoin, the above are far simpler options.

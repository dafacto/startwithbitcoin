title: How do I get some Bitcoin?
intro: You can buy Bitcoin with a bank transfer, debit or credit card, or even person-to-person.

Once you decide to buy some Bitcoin, the main question is whether to entrust the security of your Bitcoin to professionals, or do that yourself.

**Professional options** — These allow both buying *and* selling of Bitcoin.

- *Coinbase* — The most popular online option, where they store your Bitcoin for you, is [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com). Once you create an account and link your bank account, you can transfer in dollars to buy Bitcoin, and then transfer out dollars if you sell Bitcoin.
- *Crypto.com* — Another popular option is [Crypto.com](https://crypto.com/). Crypto.com is an app for iOS and Android that lets you buy Bitcoin with bank transfer or credit card. The also allows you to deposit your purchased Bitcoin into a "savings account", earning weekly interest. (And if you use my referral code `gpd9q473d2` you'll receive $50 on your first transaction.)

**Do-it-yourself options** — These allow you to buy Bitcoin with credit card, but not sell.

- *BRD Wallet* — The [BRD Wallet](https://brd.com) for iOS and Android is one of the most respected mobile wallets.
- *Hardware Wallet* — Down the road, if you buy a lot of Bitcoin, you might look into a highly secure hardware wallet, such as the [Ledger Nano](https://shop.ledger.com/?r=9be4f2a7e990).

Whichever route you go, here are some important points to keep in mind:

- All of the above allow buying and selling of *hundreds of cryptocurrencies* in addition to Bitcoin, including some with confusing names like "Bitcoin Cash"! Many people ignore all these other cryptocurrencies, and hold only the original, Bitcoin.
- Don't forget that Bitcoin can be sent as easily as email. So if you bought Bitcoin at Crypto.com, you could easily send it to your BRD or Ledger wallet for storage, and later to Coinbase for selling.
- You might hear people talking about "Bitcoin Exchanges", like Binance or Kraken. These are marketplaces where trading happens, similar to how stocks are traded in brokerage accounts. For someone who wants to just buy and hold Bitcoin, the simpler options are probably preferable.

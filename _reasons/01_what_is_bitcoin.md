intro: Bitcoin is the internet’s native form of money.

You’re probably used to using **PayPal** or your **online bank** to send, receive and manage your “money” on the internet. This is convenient, but there’s some problems:

- You have to ask **permission** to have an account with PayPal and your bank. They have the power to freeze or close your account, block your transfers, and ask questions about your money. In short, they stand between you and free use of your own money. 
- If you want to send money to your friend in Canada or France, a **conversion** has to happen between your form of money, the US Dollar, and theirs, the Canadian Dollar or Euro. PayPal and the banks charge a fee for this conversion.
- Your money itself **loses value** over time, as the United States government continually enlarges the money supply through inflation. A dollar today is worth 90% less than one in 1920.

**Bitcoin** is the internet's native form of money, and solves these problems. 

- **It's permissionless.** Just like email, anyone can access and use it, but nobody owns or controls it. Nobody can stop you from owning and using Bitcoin.
- **It's global.** Bitcoin is a worldwide currency. Just like email, you can send Bitcoin  as fast and freely to someone in Japan, as to your neighbor next door.
- **It has a limited supply.** By technical design, there will never be more than 21 million Bitcoins. In this way, Bitcoin should hold its value more like gold, than a national currency like the US dollar.

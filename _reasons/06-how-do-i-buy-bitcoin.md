Today, there are many great options for **buying and selling bitcoin**, conveniently with a bank transfer or your credit card. With simplicity in mind, we list a few convenient options [on our resources page](/resources).

Here are some things to keep in mind:

- _You don’t have to buy an entire bitcoin!_ Don’t get thrown off by the price. If you want to buy $100 of bitcoin, that’s perfectly possible!

- Most businesses that allow you to buy and sell bitcoin, also provide a _wallet service_, allowing you to store, send and receive bitcoin. Some will even pay you interest on your bitcoin, just like a savings account!

- When you store your bitcoin with someone else, you're entrusting them with the security of your bitcoin. Always remember that you have the option of controlling some or all of your bitcoin yourself, by installing your own wallet software on your phone or computer.

- Remember that bitcoin can be sent as easily as email. So if you bought bitcoin at one place, you could send it to your mobile phone wallet for storage, and later to another place for selling. There's a world of flexibility, and it's completely within your control.

- Most companies who sell bitcoin, also sell _hundreds of other cryptocurrencies_ as well, including some with confusing names like "Bitcoin Cash"! Many people ignore all these other cryptocurrencies, and hold only the original, Bitcoin.

- You might hear people talking about "Bitcoin Exchanges", like Binance or Kraken. These are marketplaces where trading happens, similar to how stocks are traded in brokerage accounts. For someone who wants to just buy and hold Bitcoin, the simpler options are probably preferable.

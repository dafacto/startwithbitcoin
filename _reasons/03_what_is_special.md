title: What’s special about Bitcoin?
intro: Bitcoin has a number of characteristics that make it unique!
---

**Bitcoin** has several characteristics that make it a **great form of money**.

- **Scarcity.** By design, there will only be 21 million Bitcoins, ever. If you own, say, 1% of all Bitcoins today (210,000 Bitcoins), you will still own 1% of all Bitcoins in a hundred years from now. The same can't be said of the US dollar, since the government continually grows the money supply through inflation. A dollar today is worth 90% less than a dollar in 1920!
- **Portability.** Traveling with $1 million dollars of Bitcoin on your phone is just as easy as traveling with $15 of Bitcoin. The same can't be said about sacks of US dollars or heavy bars of gold.
- **Divisibility.** A single Bitcoin can be divided into units of 100 million! If a single Bitcoin was worth $1 million, you could still send somebody one cent of value in Bitcoin.
- **Impossible to counterfeit.** It is mathematically impossible to counterfeit a Bitcoin. When your wallet confirms that you have received some Bitcoin, you can be sure you've received that Bitcoin.
- **Sovereign.** Most important of all — nobody in the world owns or controls Bitcoin. It is a technology that exists on the internet, just like email. You don't have to ask anybody's permission to own and use Bitcoin, and nobody can stop you. A bank can freeze your dollars, but nobody can freeze your Bitcoin!

### Do I need to understand all the tech to use Bitcoin?

Absolutely not! Remember in the early days of the personal PC, people built their own computers, and talked about CPUs, RAM and serial interfaces? Today, you just switch on your MacBook or iPhone. In a similar way, we're still in the early phases of Bitcoin, and most of the people involved are techies. Don't let that stop you from getting involved! 


### Is “Bitcoin Cash” the same thing as Bitcoin?

No, it's completely different. Since Bitcoin is "open source software", anyone can copy it anytime—and in fact, many have! I could copy the Bitcoin software today, and call it Mattcoin. But Mattcoin wouldn't have any value, unless someone were willing to pay for it. In the early days of Bitcoin, a group copied it and called it Bitcoin Cash, but as you can see from its price, it never gained the popularity of the original Bitcoin.

intro: This is where things get a little tricky, but it’s actually simpler than it seems at first.

You understand how **email** works. 

- You can install an email program on your computer or phone, like Apple Mail. That program communicates with the internet to send and receive your email, and all your email is stored on your computer or phone. You have more privacy, but if your device crashes and you don't have a backup, your email history is lost.
- You can use an online service like Gmail, that you access through a web browser like Safari. Gmail communicates with the internet to send and receive your email, and all your  email is stored on the servers at Google. You have less privacy, but if your device crashes, your email stored at Google is still safe. If Google crashes, though, your email history could be lost.

**Bitcoin** works in a similar way.

- You can install a **Bitcoin wallet** on your computer or phone. (We’ll recommend a few later.) That wallet communicates with the internet to send and receive Bitcoin. Your Bitcoin is stored on your computer or phone. You have more privacy, but if your device crashes—or gets hacked—and you don't have a backup, your Bitcoin is lost.
- You can use an **online service** that you access through a web browser like Safari. (We’ll recommend a few later.) The online service communicates with the internet to send and receive Bitcoin. Your Bitcoin is stored on the servers of the online service. You have less privacy, but if your device crashes, your Bitcoin at the online service is still safe. If the online service crashes, is hacked, or simply decides to run off with your money, your Bitcoin will be lost.

title: Should I buy some bitcoin?
intro: That’s up to you, but here is how some of the world’s most successful people answer that question.

**You have to answer that for yourself.** One way to think about the question was proposed by former PayPal director Wences Casares. 

Casares believes bitcoin will either go to zero, or over $1 million. His thinking is that if you put 1% of your savings in bitcoin, and it goes to zero, your life wouldn't change. But if it went to $1 million, your life might change a lot! 

Given this "asymmetry of outcomes" Casares believes **most people should own a small amount of Bitcoin**.

And remember, you don't have to buy an entire Bitcoin. You can buy as little as *one-hundred millionth* of a bitcoin—a unit called a "Satoshi", named after Bitcoin inventor Satoshi Nakamoto. 

So if you wanted to buy only $100 of Bitcoin, you can!

title: Should I buy some Bitcoin?
intro: That’s up to you, but here is how some of the world’s most successful people answer that question.

**You have to answer that for yourself.** One way to think about that question was posed by former PayPal director Wences Casares. 

Casares believes that Bitcoin will either go to zero, or over $1 million. If you put 1% of your savings in Bitcoin, and it went to zero, your life wouldn't change. If it went to $1 million, your life might change a lot. 

In his opinion, it therefore might make sense that **everybody own a small amount of Bitcoin**.

And remember, you don't have to buy an entire Bitcoin. You can buy as little as one-hundred millionth of a Bitcoin—a unit called a "Satoshi", named after Bitcoin's inventor Satoshi Nakamoto. 

If you want to buy only $100 of Bitcoin, you can!

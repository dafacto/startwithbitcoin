Here are some of the most popular things people do with bitcoin:

- **Hodl!** — Most people who own bitcoin share the belief that it will increase in value in the future—and therefore just hold it. In fact, many of those have plans to never sell it. Holding bitcoin affectionately is referred to as "hodling", due to an infamous misspelling years ago!
- **Invest** — Many people own a small amount of bitcoin as part of a diversified, long-term investment portfolio. If you're unfamiliar with the benefits of investment diversification, I wrote a free online book about that called [Money for Something](https://moneyforsomething.org).
- **Buy things** — Bitcoin was created to be digital money, and since its invention in 2011, a growing number of businesses accept Bitcoin as payment, for everything from coffees and haircuts, to properties and tax payments in certain places!
- **Earn interest** — Over the past few years, a number of companies have started providing Bitcoin savings accounts. You deposit your bitcoin, and receive regular interest payments—sometimes up to 5%—paid in bitcoin! A great option is [Crypto.com](https://crypto.com/), and if you use my referral code `gpd9q473d2` you'll receive $50 on your first transaction.

title: What is a Bitcoin worth?
intro: Just like all assets, Bitcoin is worth whatever the market decides itâ€™s worth.

Like any other asset, Bitcoin's worth fluctuates continually through the economics of **supply and demand**, in the market of people buying and selling Bitcoin all around the world. 

When it was invented in 2011, Bitcoin was worth nothing. At the time of this writing, it's worth $9,000.

**How valuable can it become?** Nobody knows. Here are some estimates that have been made:

- We know a lot of people hold gold as a "safe haven" asset, and we know a popular view of Bitcoin is a "digital form of gold". If 1/3 of the $8 trillion market for gold flowed into Bitcoin, a single Bitcoin would be worth **$125,000**.
- A pricing model called "Stock-to-flow" that's used to value commodities like gold and diamonds predicts a value of more than **$1 million** for Bitcoin in the future.
- Former PayPal director Wences Casares gives Bitcoin a 50% chance of being worth **$1 million** within a decade. Since it's still relatively new, he also gives it a 20% chance of being worth **$0**!

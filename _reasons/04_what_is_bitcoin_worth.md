title: What is a bitcoin worth?
intro: Just like all assets, Bitcoin is worth whatever the market decides it’s worth.
---

Like any other asset, bitcoin's value fluctuates continually in the markets of people buying and selling all around the world, through the economics of **supply and demand**, 

When it was invented in 2011, a bitcoin was worth nothing. At the time of this writing, one is worth $9,000.

**How valuable can a bitcoin become?** Nobody knows. But here are some estimates.

- A lot of people hold gold as a "safe haven" asset, and we know a popular view of Bitcoin is a "digital form of gold". If 1/3 of the $8 trillion market for gold flowed into Bitcoin, a single bitcoin would be worth **$125,000**.
- A pricing model called "Stock-to-flow" that's used to value commodities like gold and diamonds predicts a future bitcoin value of more than **$1 million**.
- Former PayPal director Wences Casares gives bitcoin a 50% chance of being worth **$1 million** within a decade. Since it's still only a decade old—compared to say, 5,000 years for gold—he also gives it a 20% chance of failing, and being worth **$zero**!

<h3>Earning Interest</h3>

A number of businesses have emerged that allow you to deposit your bitcoin, and earn interest, paid in bitcoin.

<ul>

<li><b><a href="https://crypto.com">Crypto.com</a></b> — One popular option is Crypto.com, an app for iOS and Android. If you use my referral code <code>gpd9q473d2</code> you'll receive $50 on your first transaction.</li>

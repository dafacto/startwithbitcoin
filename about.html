intro: Teaching through simplicity

<p>
As someone interested in information design, and inspired by a conversation between Peter McCormack and Dan Held about how few “top of the funnel” informational resources exist, I created this site as the beginner’s guide to Bitcoin that I would send to, say, my mother. 
</p>

<p>
It specifically avoids mentioning confusing technology that’s not essential for the average person to get involved in Bitcoin. Even the word “blockchain” isn’t mentioned, unless you happen to find your way to the technical explainer!
</p>

<p>
The resources section isn’t intended to be exhaustive, but to present a modest spectrum of solid options for the beginner. We don’t want decision paralysis!
</p>

<p>
I hope you enjoy the site, and share it with others! You can learn <a href="https://matthenderson.me">more about me here</a>, or <a href="mailto:hello@startwithbitcoin.org?subject=I have a question about Bitcoin" class="contact">send an email</a>.

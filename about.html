intro: Teaching through simplicity

<p>
As someone interested in information design, and inspired by a conversation between Peter McCormack and Dan Held about the lack “top of the funnel” Bitcoin informational resources, I created this site as the beginner’s guide that I would send to, say, my mother. 
</p>

<p>
It specifically avoids confusing technology that’s not essential for the average person to get involved—even the word “blockchain”, which you’ll only see if you happen to find your way to the technical explainer!
</p>

<p>
To avoid decision paralysis, the resources section isn’t intended to be exhaustive, but rather to present a modest spectrum of solid options for the beginner.

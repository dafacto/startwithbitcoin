My name is Matt Henderson. As someone interested in information design, I created this site as the beginner's introduction to Bitcoin that I would sent to, say, my mother. It specifically tries to avoid mentioning technology that's not essential for the average person to get involved in Bitcoin, and which may prove confusing.

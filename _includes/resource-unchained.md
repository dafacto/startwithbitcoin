[Unchained Capital](https://unchained-capital.com) (USA) â€” Unchained provides both a "2-of-3" multi-signature wallet in which the user controls two keys and Unchained capital controls a third (which would be used in case the customer loses one of their own), and Bitcoin-based loans, with the unique feature that your Bitcoin collateral is held in a segregated account (useful in some tax jurisdictions.)
